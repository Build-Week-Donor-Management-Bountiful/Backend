# Backend

IMPORTANT NOTE: You will need to log in as a user every 24 hours due to the state of the tokens.

## Utilizing This Backend

The link you will need = https://donor-backend-mw.herokuapp.com/

For all of your axios requests, this link will be a part of it.

You will need to append the following endpoints to this link to properly utilize the system.

A user that will always be present:

{
    "username": "Mack",
    "password": "pass"
}

You shouldn't need quotes, but that is the shape of the object that will be sent up to the database. 

## Authentication

### Registering a User (POST request)

Link = https://donor-backend-mw.herokuapp.com/api/auth/register/ 

You will need to send an object that looks like this: 
{
    "username": Your username here, MUST be unique!
    "password": Your password here
}

The database will return with the following information inside response.data: 
{
    "message": "User created!",
    "user": {
        "id": id of the user you created, set this to localStorage under the key "id",
        "username": The username of the user you created
    },
    "token": The token generated by registering a user (you will also receive a token by logging in), set this to localStorage under the key "token".
}

### Logging in a User (POST request)

Link = https://donor-backend-mw.herokuapp.com/api/auth/login/

You will need to send an object that looks like this: 
{
    "username": Your username here,
    "password": Your password here
}

You will receive an object that looks like this:
{
    "message": Welcome (your username)!
    "id": id of the user logged in, set this to localStorage under the key "id"
    "token": set this to localStorage under the key "token"
}


## Reading, Modifying and Removing Users

### Seeing all users (GET request)

Requirements: The token from localStorage set to the header Authorization

Link: https://donor-backend-mw.herokuapp.com/api/users/

This will return an array of all users. It will look like this:
[
    {
        "id": id of user,
        "username": username of user
    },
    {
        "id": id of user,
        "username": username of user
    }
]

### Seeing information just about the user (GET request)

Requirements: The token from localStorage set to the header Authorization

Link: https://donor-backend-mw.herokuapp.com/api/users/user

This will return an object of the user that is logged in:
{
    "id":id of user logged in,
    "username":username of user logged in
}

### Another method to see information just about the user (GET request)

Requirements: The token from localStorage set to the header Authorization

Link: https://donor-backend-mw.herokuapp.com/api/users/:id

ID (in :id) needs to be the id of a user in the database.
example: https://donor-backend-mw.herokuapp.com/api/users/1 (gets the id of the first user in the database)

This will return an object of the user that is logged in:
{
    "id":id of user logged in,
    "username":username of user logged in
}

### Update the information about the user (PUT request)

Requirements: The token from localStorage set to the header Authorization

Link: https://donor-backend-mw.herokuapp.com/api/users/:id

ID (in :id) needs to be the id of a user in the database.
example: https://donor-backend-mw.herokuapp.com/api/users/1 (gets the id of the first user in the database)

You will need to send an object that looks like this: 
{
    "username": OPTIONAL, only if you want to update the username
    "password": OPTIONAL, only if you want to update the password
}

The database will return an object like this:
{
    "id": id of the user you updated (you cannot change a user's id)
    "username": if you changed the username, this will be here
    "token": A brand new token containing information about the user, please update the token in localStorage with this information.
}

### Remove a User from the Database (DELETE Request)

Requirements: The token from localStorage set to the header Authorization

Link: https://donor-backend-mw.herokuapp.com/api/users/:id

ID (in :id) needs to be the id of a user in the database.
example: https://donor-backend-mw.herokuapp.com/api/users/1 (gets the id of the first user in the database)

You will not need to send anything to the database except for the id (put in the URL)

You will receive an object that looks like this:
{
  "message": "Removed this user",
  "removeduser": {
    "id": id of the user removed,
    "username": username of the user removed
  }
}

## Frequently Asked Questions

QUESTION: Do I need to log in after registering?
ANSWER: No. With some code and setting the token in localStorage, your user can automatically be authenticated directly after registering. You would only log in if you want to test that user. 

QUESTION: What is errno 19 in Sqlite? 
ANSWER: It means that there is already a user with that username already in the database, try a different username.
